## 💡 PRO TIPS:

1. **Be Specific** - Don't say "I love your smile", say "I love how you smile bigger when you talk about your dreams"

2. **Use Real Quotes** - Put actual things she said in the timeline

3. **Test Her Device** - If she uses iPhone, test on iPhone

4. **Keep It Secret** - Don't share the link before V-Day!

5. **Timing Matters** - Send it when she has time to explore it fully

6. **Screenshot Everything** - Keep backups of special chats

7. **Voice Quality** - Make sure audio messages are clear

8. **Proofread** - Check spelling! Nothing kills romance like typos

## 🐛 COMMON ISSUES & FIXES:

**"Images won't show"**
→ Check file names match exactly in HTML

**"Audio won't play"**
→ Make sure files are MP3 format

**"Website looks weird on phone"**
→ It's already responsive, try different browser

**"Animations not working"**
→ Make sure all 3 JS files are loading

**"Can't deploy to Netlify"**
